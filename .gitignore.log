Importance of Using .gitignore:

Keeps the Repository Clean: By ignoring unnecessary files, the repository stays clean and free of clutter, making it easier to navigate and manage.
Prevents Sensitive Data from Being Tracked: Ensures that sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, is not accidentally committed and exposed.
Improves Performance: Ignoring large files and directories that are not needed (e.g., binaries, build directories) can improve the performance of Git operations.
Reduces Merge Conflicts: Ignored files are not tracked, which helps in avoiding unnecessary merge conflicts that can arise from changes to log files or temporary files.
